When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to collaborate with some other people or to share my project or to have access to it on multiple machines.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I don't want any new commit on remote to get to me without knowing, as it could break up my local code.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks only fork on Github, clones can be done between Github and local and branches both on Github and local.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

To be able to merge commits.
