What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new folder named .git is created, containing metadata about the history of commits. nothing is commited yet, all the files are untracked.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area offers the possibility to filter what you want to commit from the directory.
