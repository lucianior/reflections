How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

The diff helped me find the bug.



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Having easy access to the entire history of a file can help me find the problems that I introduced in newer versions or even return to an older stable version.



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: you choose when to commit, auto could break your compilation
Cons: you can forget to commit or commit too large chanks of code.



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because it depends on what you need from the system. Google docs is not used for programming, people mostly save single documents that do not have a link to others.



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Use the log to see revisions, use diff for difference between 2 revisions.



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A lot more confident.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Make a first commit.
